## ATTENTION!

This project is configured as a 32bit project. It can easily been compiled as x64 or mixed - but after doing so, the project is no longer able to find installed 32bit voices. So handle with care if you want to use your 32bit voices.

### Submodules
Keep attention to get and update all the embedded submodules. Sometimes it seems to be necessary to update the submodules' resources â€“ do not submit this to the master branch of submodule

* Logger [TUD-INF-IAI-MCI/DotNet_Logger](https://github.com/TUD-INF-IAI-MCI/DotNet_Logger) - to log the audio output
